# C libraries and small applications
This is a simple playground for the C programming language, it will eventually (hopefully) contain library functions and reusable components and applications. The code and module will probably be simple as I do this in order to not forget C. Please correct any shitty code you see.

### Build
Cmake with the configuration in CMakeLists.txt. I will eventually port it to regular old makefiles, however I'd like to try CMake.
